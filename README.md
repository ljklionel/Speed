# Speed

This is a speed typing game inspired by https://monkeytype.com/ built using Blazor WASM and Blazor Server. It is the framework version of [Typing Mcqueen](https://ljklionel.github.io/Typing-Mcqueen/) that I did last month.

> :warning: **As this is the first (maybe only) version, there are tons of bugs. If it bothers you, ~cry~ please make a pr of the fix :)**

## Please read the following before attempting:
- It's still under development so there will be bugs but feel free to run it locally and try it.
